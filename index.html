                <h2>Hi There</h2>
                <p>I’ve been working for the past 10 years as a research engineer. During that time I’ve been trained and certified on a number of different projects that are to create novel biomaterial and medical devices including for treating in-vivo inflammation such as tracheal stenosis, collagen ring for eyes treatment prevent inflammation delivering drug; for treatment of Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) collagen mesh; artificial collagen tendons replaced in rabbit tendons and observed new tissue formation.  </p>
                <p>I work as a clinical lab scientist at Amazon Dx. Additionally, I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering, and my course projects are mostly concerned with bioinformatics and machine learning techniques. Furthermore, I am currently enrolled in Java Full-Stack WeCanCodeIT bootcamp  (Amazon Career Choice program).  Up to this point, I've taken graduate-level machine learning-related courses such as Applied Statistics, Machine Learning in Biomedical Engineering, Computational Biology, Computational Imaging, and Machine Learning. I am quite interested in the professions of Machine Learning, Data Science and Research Science, and I have made a concerted effort to further my knowledge in these sectors. </p>
